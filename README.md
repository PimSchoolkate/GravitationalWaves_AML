# Detecting Gravitational Waves

**Contributors**: Enric Reverter and Pim Schoolkate
A project carried out as part of the Advanced Machine Learning (AML) course by Lluis Belanche at UPC. 
 
### Objective of the project
This project aimed at detecting gravitational waves in the data gathered by the LIGO detectors. This was part of a kaggle competition which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g2net-detecting-continuous-gravitational-waves). The project should serve as an example of the contributors skills in applying machine and deep learning techniques to a complex dataset.

### Approach
1. Using support vector machines and kernel compositions.
2. Using a Denoising stacked autoencoder.

For an in-depth analysis see the project [report](https://github.com/PimSchoolkateUPC/GravitationalWaves_AML/blob/main/AML-1.pdf).
